Refresh button, and Liked Songs buttons cannot be disabled.




<br>


## Refresh button:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
***

Adds a simple UI reload button.
<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-49.png)

That's how it looks and does exactly what you think it does, refreshes UI.<br>
This tweak cannot be disabled.


<br><br>

## Liked Songs shortcut:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
***

Adds a shortcut to "Liked Songs".


<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-50.png)

"Liked Songs" text is not localized, it will show as "Liked Songs", regardless of your language.<br>
This tweak cannot be disabled (yet).

## Shift playlist title 12px to the right:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
***

<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image.png)

This tweak is simple, it shifts playlist title 12px to the right. Just makes top bar feel less clutered.
Here's before and after.

#### Before:

#### After:

## Enlarged cover art will take up full width of the sidebar:

[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
***

<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-4.png)

Stretches cover art container to fill up a full width of left sidebar. Has configurable max width also via settings, 420px is default.

![Alt text](./assets/image-5.png)

#### This is how spotify looks out of the box:

![Alt text](./assets/image-7.png)

#### And this is how it looks like after enabling the tweak:

![Alt text](./assets/image-6.png)

## And the best part is: It dynamically resizes! See the video below.

## Panel Gap Remover, and Panel Rounded Corner remover:

[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)

<br>

### These two tweaks mostly work together, however you can disable either of them and see what will happen.
<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-10.png)

#### First one allows you to remove gaps between panels. 
#### Please note that the gaps will not be visible if you have enabled the tweak to change background color to gray.

<br>

#### Second one allows you to remove rounded corners of those panels, turning them into squares. I recommend leaving it on, as square panels with gaps look kinda weird.
<br>

### BEFORE:
![Alt text](./assets/image-8.png)

<br>

### AFTER:
![Alt text](./assets/image-9.png)

<br><br><br><br>

## Background Color Tweaks:

[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
<br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-11.png)

#### Those two settings allow you to change color scheme to similiar scheme that 2017 spotify had.

Extension currently has no support for custom colors, I may add it if there is a demand. 

If you want that feature, tell me by creating an issue.

## Hide small covers in tracklists:

[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)

### This simple tweak hides covers in tracklists, playlists and queues.

#### Not everyone will like this change, you can disable it if you don't like it.
<br>

#### Note: This will not save you any data, Spotify will still waste bandwidth downloading all those covers, this tweak just hides them.

### AFTER:

## "My library" filters are less rounded:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
<br><br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-16.png)

This will be best shown with an ./assets/image, take a look.

## Remove rounded corners from "My Library" entries:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
<br><br>

### Bugged out, currently useless and better left off.
#### Will update this, when fixed.
![Alt text](./assets/image-19.png)

This tweak is supposed to make items in "My Library" list square instead of rounded. <br>
Currently does not work at all. So you can safely ignore it and move on.

## Underscore tracklist entries:
[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
<br><br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-20.png)
<br>
<br>
This tweak underscores each song in tracklists, queues etc.
Makes it look more like 2017 Spotify.

[Go back up](#hello-to-legacytweaks-docs-of-sort)
<br><br>

![Alt text](./assets/image-29.png)

Track rows are more compact, allowing more of them to fit on screen.<br>
If you don't like the way it looks, feel free to disable it.

Here's a comparison.
